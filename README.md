# 3DPrinter-VRail-Camera-System
Solidworks files for RaspberryPi and Arduino based camera system. The system will be used to control the 3D printer and monitor ongoing prints and provide alerts to my smartphone. STL, 3MF, and GCODE files will be added in the near future.

Please display the preview images (Photo 1 and Photo 2) by either downloading them or opening images in a new tab. Github does not scale down the images to fit the window.
